# Crisp
Crisp is a simple 3D-2D engine.  It stores and manipulates objects in 3D and then projects them in 2D. Check out the following files to see some 3D models I built using this project: arch.gif, capitol_house.gif, golden-gate-bridge.gif, shapes.gif, arch.gif (Please give the files a couple seconds to load).
